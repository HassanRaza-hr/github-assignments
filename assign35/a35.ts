//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
let animals:string[]=["dog","cat","piegon"];
for(let i=0;i<animals.length;i++){
    var anim=animals[i]
    console.log(`${anim} is one of the best pet and is loyal to their owner.`)
}
console.log("these pet animal are very loyal to their owner and love them")
